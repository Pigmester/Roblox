-Auto Updates

*To prevent conflicts and to prevent discovery by developers, please try to use this in a private server.
  They are not expensive and the payout is worth it if you plan to go far in this game.
*Some features may be disabled randomly, this is due to maintenance. I will eventually add an indicator to let you know what is under maintenance.
*The menu will not appear in-game UNTIL you click play and initiate your save file
*Side bonus: Can be placed in autoexec folder. Script will only run/launch in this specific game (script checks for PlaceId)

***There is a freeze upon launching the script. This is normal and is sadly a part of the obfuscation method I use. I will have this fixed soon enough. As much of a "break"
  as it appears to look like, I promise this is not your client having a meltdown. My best guess is it's Synapse/Other injector working through the decryption process.
-My scripts are encrypted solely for making reverse engineering a pain. Scripts get stolen and altered all too much these days. I'm sorry for loadstrings otherwise.

__Features__
-Auto Bake Christmas Resources
-Auto farm Forgotten Tix
-Auto farm Rainbow Tix
-Auto click trees and generator (must be within a certain distance of the generator for generator to take effect)
-Auto collect nearby Tix
-Auto click Christmas rocks
-Auto buy buttons
-Auto Rebirth
-Auto Recreate (Does take skip rebirth 0 research into account, and will disable AutoBuy until rebirth 0 is skipped)
