-Auto Updates

*To prevent conflicts and to prevent discovery by developers, please try to use this in a private server.
  They are not expensive and the payout is worth it if you plan to go far in this game.
*Some features may be disabled randomly, this is due to maintenance. I will eventually add an indicator to let you know what is under maintenance.
*The menu will not appear in-game UNTIL you click play and initiate your save file
*Side bonus: Can be placed in autoexec folder. Script will only run/launch in this specific game (script checks for PlaceId)
